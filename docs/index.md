### Battery selection
- 12V battery. Usually come with a spare charger.
- 18650 in series. Output: 3.7V
- 3x 18650 in paralell. Output 11.1V. Needs special charging/balancing circuit. Not recommended.

When using 18650 batteries in series make sure to connect a BMS circuit and a charging circuit. Following parts are required for a safe 18650 assembly:
- Charger: TP4056 (1A) or IP2312 (3A)
- BMS: 1S-3876 (5A)
- 18650 battery holder

**NOTE:** in case of TP405 choose the version without integrated BMS or it will constantly turn off the power due to high starting current of the motors!

### Servo motors
The two types of servos are: 
- SG90: micro servo motor with plastic gears
- MG90: micro servo motor with metal gears

Both servos need a 5V power supply. To attach a servo use standard servo pan/tilt mount with the [Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4934734)

### Main board
At the moment, the only tested board is [ESP32-CAM by AiThinker](http://www.ai-thinker.com/pro_view-24.html)

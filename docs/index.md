### Servo motors
The two types of servos are: 
- SG90: micro servo motor with plastic gears
- MG90: micro servo motor with metal gears

Both servos need a 5V power supply. To attach a servo use standard servo pan/tilt mount with the [Clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4934734)

### Main board
At the moment, the only tested board is [ESP32-CAM by AiThinker](http://www.ai-thinker.com/pro_view-24.html)
